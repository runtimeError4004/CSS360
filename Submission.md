### Individual Report
Each team member should individually make a choice for the SDLC for each project.   This choice should be made individually before discussing the projects with the overall team.  The report should contain each team member's answer and a brief justification (2-3 sentences), for each project.  (i.e. If you have 5 team members, there should be 5 people x 7 projects = 35 total answers and justifications).

Consider how to use markdown features to organize and display this information in a neat manner.  (e.g. tables, lists, headers, separate pages are all options here).

### Group Report
After everyone has made their individual selections, the group should come together and make a final team decision on the SDLC for each project.  For each project, your group should have the following information.

The final teamâ€™s answer/SDLC choice
Thorough justification for why this model was selected for this project (i.e., What makes it a good fit? How can this SDLC help with developing this project?)
1-2 other models that were considered, and why the final selection won out over them.  
The 1-2 key aspects of the project that were most important to your final SDLC decision.  Explain why these aspects are critical to this decision.
