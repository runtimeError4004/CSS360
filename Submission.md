### Individual Report
Each team member should individually make a choice for the SDLC for each project.   This choice should be made individually before discussing the projects with the overall team.  The report should contain each team member's answer and a brief justification (2-3 sentences), for each project.  (i.e. If you have 5 team members, there should be 5 people x 7 projects = 35 total answers and justifications).

Consider how to use markdown features to organize and display this information in a neat manner.  (e.g. tables, lists, headers, separate pages are all options here).

### Group Report
After everyone has made their individual selections, the group should come together and make a final team decision on the SDLC for each project.  For each project, your group should have the following information.

The final teamâ€™s answer/SDLC choice
Thorough justification for why this model was selected for this project (i.e., What makes it a good fit? How can this SDLC help with developing this project?)
1-2 other models that were considered, and why the final selection won out over them.  
The 1-2 key aspects of the project that were most important to your final SDLC decision.  Explain why these aspects are critical to this decision. 

#### Markdown
Your entire report must be written in markdown language.  Your submission will be graded on its formatting and overall presentation (in its rendered form).

Your submission must feature at least 4 of the following markdown features.  The features must be used in a sensible way within the context of the report.  

- Headers
- Text formatting
- Blockquote(s)
- External link(s)
- Internal link(s)
- Embedded photo(s)
- Table(s)
- List(s)

#### GitHub
Your team must use a shared GitHub repository to develop your submission. 

- Use a public GitHub repository and share the link in your submission.
- Each student must have at least 4 commits.  There is no minimum size for each commit (in fact, more and shorter commits are recommended)
- Each commit must have a meaningful title and a brief description.

#### What to Turn In
- A link to the GitHub project where your team developed the report.  You can include this link at the top of your report or add it in a comment on the assignment.
- One or more .md files containing your report.
