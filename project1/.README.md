### Project life-cycles

#### Summary
The goal of this exercise is to work in groups to discuss issues and select an appropriate software development lifecycle (SDLC) model for each of the following seven projects. Consider yourselves as being the program/project manager for each project development team. Being in the shoes of the PM, you will need to justify the decision to the team.  

Each individual in the group will select their choice for the SLDC model and justify it for each project independently. Then, the whole team as a group will need to come to a consensus/decision on the model for each project, and justify their selection.

Additionally, we will get practice using source control (GitHub) to work on a shared project and Markdown to format written text.

##### Markdown
Your entire report must be written in markdown language.  Your submission will be graded on its formatting and overall presentation (in its rendered form).

Your group submission must feature at least 4 of the following markdown features.  The features must be used in a sensible way within the context of the report.
