### Projects
For each of the following project proposals, choose a lifecycle model and justify your decision.  

#### #1: New e-Commerce site
PerfectApparel wants to launch a new e-Commerce site to sell clothes, shoes, and accessories. The company wants to provide an online shopping experience that will attract customers to come back to the site. For example, customers may select their own colors, create their customized design, and quickly find matching outfits. 

Today, PerfectApparel mainly uses in-house templates with its own custom scripting and extensions to create web sites. An interpreter written in Java reads the templates and scripting and generates the appropriate web page based on a customer’s request. Your management expects you to use same tools with minor modifications to generate HTML5 pages and extensions needed for the new features. 

 Your team consists of a combination of developers from your previous projects, new hires, and interns. You will need to define requirements for any template or scripting extensions that you want and schedule their development with a separate group that develops the Java interpreter and related software.


Since the platform being created is going to be done online with a rotating selection of products, it is inherently a project that is updated constantly. It should be done through Agile. Given that there are multiple teams that are involved in this process, each team should prioritize their strengths.


#### #2: Dental office site
Your good friend, a dentist, asks you to develop a web site for their new clinic. The web site should include common information about the clinic like hours, location, dental staff, and downloadable forms.  At some point in the future, they would like to include an ability to make online appointments, send automated reminders via text messages, and issue discounts. Your friend is flexible with the time when you will deliver software.  They also wish to continually add capabilities to the website in order to draw more patients to their clinic.


While this project is done entirely online, there are actually not as many things that need to be updated from week to week. The owner already has a clear outline of what they need now and what they expect in the future, so a plan can be built around that. This can be done through waterfall SDLC.


#### #3: Nuclear Power Plant
You have been assigned to oversee the development of software that will monitor the status of a new nuclear power plant.  You have a group of scientists who can provide you with domain knowledge to help you design the software.   

Because of news of previous power plant failures, e.g., Three Mile Island and the more recent Fukushima-1 event in Japan, you want to make sure that the software you are designing will be robust, is able to deal with hardware failure, and can fail safely.  The software is expected to last for a long time (at least 10 years). 

The utility company who owns the power plant allows you to subcontract parts of the software development, but you are ultimately responsible for the overall operation of the software. 


This is very clearly a waterfall project. There is no room for adjustments on the fly. it is crucial that the project is well thoughtout, clearly understood by each of its engineers. There is no room for misinterpretation or improvision here.


#### #4: Department of Transportation
Your company won the contract to develop a distributed application which stores data on the Cloud.  This is in response to a thorough 100 page specifications from the Department of Transportation. The specifications is very detailed in what’s expected from the application. 

 Your company has developed similar solutions in the transportation domain on numerous previous occasions, and you have the appropriate experienced staff for the project. You bid on the project to be completed within 18 months based on a team of 10 software engineers.


This can be done with the iterative process. There are so many specifications that even if everything is well documented and organized, there will still be mistakes that can be identified and refined by providing the customer to navigate the platform and make their own determination as to what along the process must be redone. 


#### #5: Reducing Traffic
An experienced technology company hires you to manage a new project that incorporates distributed computing and networking with car tracking equipment. The equipment will be used to monitor individual cars (via GPS tracking devices) and general traffic (via sensors and cameras) in both surface streets and freeways.  Transportation officials should also be able to provide real-time traffic updates on digital billboards along the roads.   

Your team has mainly created proprietary hardware/software solutions in the past. The team has substantially skills in using object-oriented C++ to develop embedded systems.


given that the project has defined proprietary hardware and embedded systems, this would require the waterfall method. There are very few opportunities to release live updates in the future in the event that things need to be changed, so it should be our teams intention to release the product once. 


#### #6: Educational game
You lead a small experienced team of 7 developers from a gaming company. Your team is responsible for quickly developing educational games based on preliminary and evolving set of requirements.  You have internal and external customers who expect to use your games ASAP for their own testing efforts. You have a team member who participates on educational conferences as well as acts a marketing representative to your customers, the teachers and administrators at your local school district.


This would require the iterative process. While the educators can easily provide us with what games they want us to produce, it wont be without their feedback that we can refine it to the point that they are receiving what they hope for. As we reach the end phase of a product their feedback will allowus to return later down the line a product that is not only fun, but meeting the requirements they deem necessary.

#### #7: Global Health
You and your friends won a multi-million dollar grant from a foundation to develop software to address current global challenges.  Your startup company is also eligible to receive further grants if it can demonstrate significant positive impact on the health of the people residing in developing countries.  

Your whole company currently only has 5 people. You will need to hire team members as part of the development effort. Your starting team consists of 2-3 developers who you know very well from previous projects.

## 7 This one is hard to say. I would pitch agile, only because of the text that states "you can receive further grants if it can *demonstrate* significant positive impact". This leads me to believe that while our core product is already deemed successful enough to get the investment of grant money, there is still room to find other ways to innovate in the future. We do not have any targets to aim for at this time, so we can keep the restrictions of scope open until we make further progress.
