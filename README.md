# Brief:       
#### KeyPer is a password manager application.  

> Team FamJam intends to deliver a password manager application to create, store, and retrieve user login information. All relevant data, such as website names, usernames, passwords, and successful or unsuccessful password bank login attempts, as well as the metadata, such as date and time associated with the creation or retrieval of each of these events, will be stored in a SQL database. Passwords will be encrypted and decrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The primary goal of this project is to provide our users with a secure method for storing and retrieving sensitive information, particularly in an era where malicious actors have more and more methods to access it.
