# 1: New e-Commerce site
## The final team’s answer/SDLC choice
The **Agile** method was selected
## Thorough justification for why this model was selected for this project (i.e., What makes it a good fit? How can this SDLC help with developing this project?)
> "Because the site requires frequrnt updates, customer-focused features, and a highly interactive design process with a team of people with mixed levels of experience."
> "The software requires a coordination with a group of maintaining Java interpreter."
Agile method was preferred because of the following:
1. It allows for an incremental development.
2. Early/continuous feedback from users.
3. It is felexible and adaptive (changes in the requirements). 
## 1-2 other models that were considered, and why the final selection won out over them.  
| Method     | Pros                                           | Cons                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------|
| Iterative  | Allows gradual improvements, early testing     | Not easy to document, still regulated   |
| Waterfall  | Clear structure, well-documented               | hard to go back to previous stages      |

Agile method helps in collaborative approach to the development focusing on small deliverables and working in short cycles like sprints. It is also a good approach because teams gather feedback from their customers. 

## The 1-2 key aspects of the project that were most important to your final SDLC decision.  Explain why these aspects are critical to this decision. 
   1. The platform is hosted online with a rotating selection of products, so it will need frequent updates and re-deployments. An Agile approach will allow us to meet these frequency demands.
   2. Our team members are proficient in different parts of the development, so we need a lifecycle that allows developers to play to their strengths. Agile allows us to divide work among developers to play into strengths.

# 2: Dental office site
## The final team’s answer/SDLC choice
The **Waterfall** method was selected
## Thorough justification for why this model was selected for this project (i.e., What makes it a good fit? How can this SDLC help with developing this project?)

## 1-2 other models that were considered, and why the final selection won out over them.  
| Method     | Pros                                           | Cons                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------|
| Agile      | Rapid development                              | Not useful for strict, regulated domain |
| Iterative  | Allows gradual improvements, early testing     | Not easy to document, still regulated   |


## The 1-2 key aspects of the project that were most important to your final SDLC decision.  Explain why these aspects are critical to this decision. 
   1. The website is not going to be updated frequently, and the details of those updates are known ahead of time. As such, the specification phase for Waterfall will be rather short.
   2. Considering the context of a dental clinic, the systems we developed need to be well-tested and reliable. The Waterfall approach will allow us to verify that developed systems for the dental clinic will be reliable for any end customer.


# 3: Nuclear Power Plant
## The final team’s answer/SDLC choice
The **Spiral** method was selected

## Thorough justification for why this model was selected for this project (i.e., What makes it a good fit? How can this SDLC help with developing this project?)
> "Because of news of previous power plant failures... you want to make sure that the software you are designing will be robust, is able to deal with hardware failure, and can fail safely."
> "The software is expected to last for a long time (at least 10 years)."
Spiral was preferred because it allows the programmers to continuously apply risk management and quality tests as they go on with development [for three reasons.](https://teachingagile.com/sdlc/models/spiral)
1. It allows for multiple phases of development and tracking of safety measures
2. It allows for the experimentation of prototypes that are intended to limit risk,
3. It allows for the result to be flexible with changing guidance and rules.

| Waterfall  | Clear structure, well-documented               | hard to go back to previous stages      |

The Spiral model combines the structured, sequential approach of Waterfall with the flexibility and risk-reduction strategies of iterative development.

## The 1-2 key aspects of the project that were most important to your final SDLC decision.  Explain why these aspects are critical to this decision. 
1. High Reliability and Safety Requirements
It was crucial that we choose a SDLC that allows us to develop and track our systems of systems. The company that owns the powerplant has allowed us to get third party involvement in our solutions.
We should hire consulting teams to receive guidance on concerns that allow us to make multiple rounds of assessments as progress moves forward.
2. Long-Term Maintenance and Longevity
By having the requirement that it must be *"able to deal with hardware failure, and can fail safely"* means that part of our testing is *making* the plant crash intentionally and in a controlled manner. 
Since we cannot prepare for every single possible indefinitely through the first shot at a solution, Spiral SDLC allows us to come up with new safety concerns and solutions continuously.

# 4: Department of Transportation
## The final team’s answer/SDLC choice
The **Waterfall** method was selected
## Thorough justification for why this model was selected for this project (i.e., What makes it a good fit? How can this SDLC help with developing this project?)
> "Because the Department of Transportation provided a 100-page, detailed, and fixed specification document and the requirements are structured and unlikely to be changed, requires phase-by-phase development to ensure accountability and quality."
> "Given an experienced team in this domain and 18-month timeline with 10 software engineers."
Waterfall model was preferred because it allows programmers to do the following:
1. Comprehensive documnetation
2. Phase-by-phase development to ensure accountability and quality assurance requirements.
3. Structure needed to complete project within scope, time.  

## 1-2 other models that were considered, and why the final selection won out over them.  
| Method     | Pros                                           | Cons                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------|
| Iterative  | Allows gradual improvements, early testing     | Not easy to document, still regulated   | // replace whichever one you dont use
| Waterfall  | Clear structure, well-documented               | hard to go back to previous stages      |

The Waterfall model helps with a well-defined documentation with clear structure and a phase-by-phase development which ensures accountability. 

## The 1-2 key aspects of the project that were most important to your final SDLC decision.  Explain why these aspects are critical to this decision. 
   1. **Detailed and Fixed requirements**
      The project has a comprehensive 100-page requirement document. The Waterfall model was best approach when the scope is known from the start, hence minimizing the risk. 
   2. **Experienced Team**
      With a defined team of 10 engineers with a timeline of 18 months, Waterfall method allows us to execute the project in a step-by-step (phase-by-phase), directed manner. Prior domain experience further makes it clear for us to use this structured model. 


# 5: Reducing Traffic
## The final team’s answer/SDLC choice
The **Waterfall** method was selected

## Thorough justification for why this model was selected for this project (i.e., What makes it a good fit? How can this SDLC help with developing this project?)

> The waterfall method was selected as it allows a stuctured and organized approach. The project has clear goals from the start, so the waterfall method will work well here. Our team is also experienced in building embedded systems using C++, which is supported by the waterfall model, and allows us through this method to focus one phase at a time.

## 1-2 other models that were considered, and why the final selection won out over them.  
| Method     | Pros                                           | Cons                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------|
| Spiral     | Manages risks and integrates prototypes early  | Too complex in this situation           |
| Iterative  | Allows gradual improvements, early testing     | Not easy to document, still regulated   |


## The 1-2 key aspects of the project that were most important to your final SDLC decision.  Explain why these aspects are critical to this decision. 
   1. Clear and fixed requirements,
      The project has a very clear goal to track cars and monitor traffic, while also showing real time updates. In this situation, we already know what the system has to do, therefore we shouldn't expect the requirements to really change, which is why the waterfall mehtod is preffered.

# 6: Educational game
## The final team’s answer/SDLC choice
The **Iterative** method was selected

## Thorough justification for why this model was selected for this project (i.e., What makes it a good fit? How can this SDLC help with developing this project?)

> While the educators can easily provide us with what games they want us to produce, it wont be without their feedback that we can refine it to the point that they are receiving what they hope for.As we reach the end phase of a product their feedback will allowus to return later down the line a product that is not only fun, but meeting the requirements they deem necessary.

> Our team is small enough, and requirements evolving enough. We need to be able to develop our games with requirements that change on a dime, and be able to quickly deliver our games to our customers.


1. perfect model for evolving requirements that need feedback after every phase.
2. Testing after each versions allows you the abilty to catch bugs eariler on.
3. small, well expirence team can handle fast cycles of build-test-improve effficeiently.
4. can deliver useable eariler models eariler on.


## 1-2 other models that were considered, and why the final selection won out over them.  
| Method     | Pros                                           | Cons                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------|
| Waterfall  | Clear structure, well-documented               | hard to go back to previous stages      | // replace whichever one you dont use
| agile      | Allows gradual improvements, early testing     | Not easy to document, still regulated   |

Iteration is better than the Waterfall method for the educational game because it allows the team to quickly adapt to changing requirements.

## The 1-2 key aspects of the project that were most important to your final SDLC decision.  Explain why these aspects are critical to this decision. 
   1. Delivers a usable model of the software early on
      The iterative model focuses on creating a working version of the product early in the development cycle. This is perfect for your educational game project because it allows teachers and 
      administrators to start testing the game right away.
   2. Feedback loop from marketing team and testers.
      Since you have a team member actively attending educational conferences and connecting with teachers, the iterative model lets you make the most of that real-time feedback. After every 
      iteration, the input from actual educators can guide your next steps.



# #7: Global Health
## The final team’s answer/SDLC choice
The **Agile** method was selected

## Thorough justification for why this model was selected for this project (i.e., What makes it a good fit? How can this SDLC help with developing this project?)

> since the project’s success depends on demonstrating a significant positive impact, Agile allows your team to make continuous changes and improvements based on feedback and results. 

> Agile’s iterative nature supports ongoing experimentation and feature development. With no fixed targets yet, the team can keep the project scope open.

1.Encourages collaboration with stakeholders and users.

2.Enables continuous testing and real-world feedback.

3.Ever evolving goals can be supported much easier compared to other models like the waterfall.


## 1-2 other models that were considered, and why the final selection won out over them.  
| Method     | Pros                                           | Cons                                    |

| Waterfall  | Clear structure, well-documented               | hard to go back to previous stages      |

Agile allows for continuous changes and improvements, while Waterfall locks in requirements early 

## The 1-2 key aspects of the project that were most important to your final SDLC decision.  Explain why these aspects are critical to this decision. 
   1. Unclear targets and ever evolving requiremnts,
      The project does not have strict goals at the beginning, and its direction depends on how well the software performs in real-world settings. Agile supports this uncertainty by allowing 
      flexibility in planning and development.


     
   2. Continuous Testing and Improvement,
      The success of the software—and the chance for future grants—depends on how well it performs in real use. Agile supports continuous testing, allowing the team to identify issues early, 
      gather user feedback.
