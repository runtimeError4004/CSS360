> The software is expected to last for a long time (at least 10 years). 
    
## 1-2 other models that were considered, and why the final selection won out over them.  
| Method     | Pros                                           | Cons                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------|
| Agile      | Rapid development                              | Not useful for strict, regulated domain |
| Iterative  | Allows gradual improvements, early testing     | Not easy to document, still regulated   |
| Waterfall  | Clear structure, well-documented               | hard to go back to previous stages      |

Waterfall was preferred because the other two were far too prone to mistakes over a longer period of time.
