| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------|
| Agile      | Rapid development                              | Not useful for strict, regulated domain |

# 3: Nuclear Power Plant
## The final team’s answer/SDLC choice
The **Spiral** method was selected

## Thorough justification for why this model was selected for this project (i.e., What makes it a good fit? How can this SDLC help with developing this project?)
>"Because of news of previous power plant failures... you want to make sure that the software you are designing will be robust, is able to deal with hardware failure, and can fail safely."
> "The software is expected to last for a long time (at least 10 years)."
Spiral was preferred because it allows the programmers to continuously apply risk management and quality tests as they go on with development [for three reasons.](https://teachingagile.com/sdlc/models/spiral)
1. It allows for multiple phases of development and tracking of safety measures
2. It allows for the experimentation of products and functions that limit risk,
3. It allows for the result to be flexible with changing guidance and rules.

The Spiral model combines the structured, sequential approach of Waterfall with the flexibility and risk-reduction strategies of iterative development.

## The 1-2 key aspects of the project that were most important to your final SDLC decision.  Explain why these aspects are critical to this decision. 
1. High Reliability and Safety Requirements
It was crucial that we choose a SDLC that allows us to develop and track our systems of systems. The company that owns the powerplant has allowed us to get third party involvement in our solutions.
We should hire consulting teams to receive guidance on concerns that allow us to make multiple rounds of assessments as progress moves forward.
2. Long-Term Maintenance and Longevity
By having the requirement that it must be *"able to deal with hardware failure, and can fail safely"* means that part of our testing is *making* the plant crash intentionally and in a controlled manner. 
Since we cannot prepare for every single possible indefinitely through the first shot at a solution, Spiral SDLC allows us to come up with new safety concerns and solutions continuously.

# 6: Educational game
## The final team’s answer/SDLC choice
The **Iterative** method was selected

## Thorough justification for why this model was selected for this project (i.e., What makes it a good fit? How can this SDLC help with developing this project?)

> While the educators can easily provide us with what games they want us to produce, it wont be without their feedback that we can refine it to the point that they are receiving what they hope for.As we reach the end phase of a product their feedback will allowus to return later down the line a product that is not only fun, but meeting the requirements they deem necessary.

> Our team is small enough, and requirements evolving enough. We need to be able to develop our games with requirements that change on a dime, and be able to quickly deliver our games to our customers.


1. perfect model for evolving requirements that need feedback after every phase.
2. Testing after each versions allows you the abilty to catch bugs eariler on.
3. small, well expirence team can handle fast cycles of build-test-improve effficeiently.
4. can deliver useable eariler models eariler on.

## The 1-2 key aspects of the project that were most important to your final SDLC decision.  Explain why these aspects are critical to this decision. 
   1. Delivers a usable model of the software early on
      The iterative model focuses on creating a working version of the product early in the development cycle. This is perfect for your educational game project because it allows teachers and 
      administrators to start testing the game right away.
   2. Feedback loop from marketing team and testers.
      Since you have a team member actively attending educational conferences and connecting with teachers, the iterative model lets you make the most of that real-time feedback. After every 
      iteration, the input from actual educators can guide your next steps.
