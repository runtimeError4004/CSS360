1. Since the platform being created is going to be done online with a rotating selection of products, it is inherently a project that is updated constantly. It should be done through Agile. Given that there are multiple teams that are involved in this process, each team should prioritize their strengths.

2. While this project is done entirely online, there are actually not as many things that need to be updated from week to week. The owner already has a clear outline of what they need now and what they expect in the future, so a plan can be built around that. This can be done through waterfall SDLC.

3. This can be done with the iterative process. There are so many specifications that even if everything is well documented and organized, there will still be mistakes that can be identified and refined by providing the customer to navigate the platform and make their own determination as to what along the process must be redone. 

4. This can be done with the iterative process. There are so many specifications that even if everything is well documented and organized, there will still be mistakes that can be identified and refined by providing the customer to navigate the platform and make their own determination as to what along the process must be redone. 

5. given that the project has defined proprietary hardware and embedded systems, this would require the waterfall method. There are very few opportunities to release live updates in the future in the event that things need to be changed, so it should be our teams intention to release the product once. 

6. This would require the iterative process. While the educators can easily provide us with what games they want us to produce, it wont be without their feedback that we can refine it to the point that they are receiving what they hope for. As we reach the end phase of a product their feedback will allowus to return later down the line a product that is not only fun, but meeting the requirements they deem necessary.

7. This one is hard to say. I would pitch agile, only because of the text that states "you can receive further grants if it can *demonstrate* significant positive impact". This leads me to believe that while our core product is already deemed successful enough to get the investment of grant money, there is still room to find other ways to innovate in the future. We do not have any targets to aim for at this time, so we can keep the restrictions of scope open until we make further progress.

1. We should use an Agile approach to develop the website. Implementation and configuration can be used to re-purpose the Java template interpreter, while an iterative Agile lifecycle can be used for the rest of the website as needed. Software updates can be deployed quick and easily through cloud infrastructure.

2. The requirements for the clinic website are simple enough that we should once again use an interative lifecycle. There is no safety or security-critical components that require significant design and requirement documentation ahead of time to consider a waterfall approach.

3. Considering the financial and medical implications of a failed nuclear power plant, this is a project that should be done right the first time. Thus, we should use a waterfall approach to ensure that our nuclear power plant software is safe, dependable, and secure.

4. The specifications and requirements are already laid out by the Department of Transportation, and our company already has experienced staff who has worked in similar software. Thus, we can get away with using an Agile approach to speed up our development times, referring to the DoT's specifications as much as possible while making efficient use of our staff.

5. Given the context of our company, we may already be familiar with the Waterfall method to develop embedded systems. Considering we are likely goign to use embedded or proprietary hardware, we should keep to what is known and continue to use the Waterfall lifecycle.

6. Our team is small enough, and requirements evolving enough, that it makes the most sense to use an Agile approach such as scrum. We need to be able to develop our games with requirements that change on a dime, and be able to quickly deliver our games to our customers.

7. Considering the vast amounts of legal implications of working with health, it would be best to be safe and use a waterfall approach despite the small size of our team.

1. I would say using the **agile** model would be best because the platform requires frequent updates and it is going to be online. Knowing that there are teams of different people in the project, each member has their own skills set which could be put in to provide deliverables. 

2. This project is wholly online but the requirements of the project stays the same throughout the time like scheduling appointment and stuff. Because of these requirements are fixed I would say **waterfall** model would be best approach as it is a plan-driven model where design, implementation, testing and more are done in a linear sequence.

3. I would say this could be done through **spiral** model. As the project requires the monitoring of the status of the new nuclear power plant, there could be risks involved and be done with one thing after the other.

4. I would say using **iterative** process would be best approach. The project requires multiple detailed specifications which might result is some sort of mistake in between. This approach allows early feedback from the users which would in turn allows improvement throughout the process.

5. Given the description of our company, we are already familiar with developing the embedded systems using waterfall method. Knowing that we have created proprietary hardware solutions in the past, we would like to move on with **waterfall** method to work with. 

6. I would say working with **agile** model would be best. The project requires us to work in small teams and the evolving set of requirements. It allows a fast delivery and given that we have to make the development of the game quick so the customers can use it for their own testing efforts. 

7. I would go for **agile** model for this project. We might need to make changes throughout to ensure positive impact as it might give the chance to our company for further grants based on these results.

1. I think using an agile model would be ideal in an e-Commerce platform. Since this is done online, the agile method would help manage coordination between teams and allows continuous feedback from team members.

2. For a dental office site, my way to go would be taking an incremental approach. This dental site can be developed in different phases or steps, and new features can slowly be added step by step, allowing flexibility.

3. When looking at the potentinal risks of a nuclear powwer plant, it would be best to go with the spiral model. The spiral model would allow us to identify risk and validation at early development stages.

1. A Online Clothing site will need to be constanly updated with new stock and different designs that why I belive we need to use a Constantly changing model like the Agile method. Agile medel is perfect for web based software and can be used quickly to update and is also fast-evolving. 

2. I Think for a dental office site we can once again use agile. since the requirements and procedures may grow over time like adding different functions, appointment making and rescheduling the agile method can give the flexibility it needs to thrive.

3. A Nuclear power point is extremely risky and if the software that monitors it fails extreme destruction may follow so I belive we should use the spiral model. with this model you can Identify the risks early and at every phase. it can involve multiple rounds of planning, development, testing, and evaluation so the software can succeed.

4. I Think for this project we can use the waterfall model since all the requiremtns and have been detailed and sent to use with proper documentation. With similar work expirence in this type of software going back to eariler phases is not needed.

5. Since a traffic system is an embedded software I belive a waterfall model can be used. Since the team is already familar with the approach system relibility and safety become the main points.

6. For a video Game I belive an agile method like scrum is the best. With ever changing requirements and constanly needed feedback from the players it need ot be updating quickly where scrum comes to effect.

7. For a healthcare system in another country the risk can be quite dangerous so i belive the spiral method can be used here. Identifyjng the major risks ealier on could be a game changer.
